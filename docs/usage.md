# üìò Usage Guide

## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating Your First Post

Blog posts are created as individual YAML files stored in the `src/blog-posts/` directory. Each YAML file represents a single blog post with structured metadata and Markdown content.

Alternatively, you can create visually using the AdminPage available at `/admin`, which generates these YAML files for you.

### Example:

```yaml
# src/blog-posts/hello-world.yaml
id: hello-world
slug: hello-world
title: Hello World
featured: true
excerpt: My first blog post with Tinynews
author: Your Name
date: 2024-07-27
tags:
  - introduction
  - getting-started
readTime: 3 min
content: |
  # Hello World

  Welcome to my new blog powered by **Tinynews**!

  This is incredibly easy to use:
  - Write in Markdown
  - Configure with YAML
  - Deploy anywhere

  Happy blogging! üöÄ
```

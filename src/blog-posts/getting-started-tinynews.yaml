  # Getting Started with Tinynews

  Welcome to **Tinynews**! You've just cloned one of the simplest yet most powerful blog systems available. This post will walk you through everything you need to know to get your blog up and running.

  ## What Makes Tinynews Different?

  Unlike traditional blog platforms that require databases, complex CMSs, or vendor lock-in, Tinynews takes a refreshingly simple approach:

  - **YAML-powered content** - Each blog post is a simple YAML file
  - **Markdown for writing** - Write your content in familiar Markdown syntax
  - **Git-based workflow** - Version control your content alongside your code
  - **Static generation** - Lightning-fast loading with no server dependencies

  ## Creating Your First Post

  Creating a new blog post is as simple as adding a new YAML file to the `src/blog-posts/` directory. Here's the basic structure:

  ```yaml
  id: my-awesome-post
  slug: my-awesome-post
  featured: false
  title: My Awesome Post

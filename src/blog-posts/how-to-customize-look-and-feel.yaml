  # How to Customize Your Blog’s Look and Feel

  Tinynews is designed to be flexible and easy to personalize.

  ## Change the Theme

  - Edit your Tailwind or CSS files in `src/` to adjust colors and fonts.
  - Use the `ThemeToggle` component to enable dark mode.

  ## Update Icons

  - Change the blog page icon in `site-config.ts` (e.g., use `BookOpen`, `Sparkles`, or your own).

  ## Add Your Own Styles

  - Create new CSS classes or update `App.css` for custom layouts.
  - Add images or backgrounds to make your blog unique.

  ## Pro Tip

  - Preview your changes locally before deploying.
  - Use version control to track your design tweaks.

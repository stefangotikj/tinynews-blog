  # Customizing Tinynews with `site-config.ts`

  One of the best parts of Tinynews is how easy it is to configure. Everything about your blog's look, behavior, and metadata is centralized inside a single file: `site-config.ts`.

  Let's walk through each section and explore what it does and how you can tweak it to match your brand or personality.

  ## üè∑Ô∏è Basic Site Info

  This section controls your blog's identity ‚Äî things like the title, logo, and general description.

  ```ts
  title: "My Awesome Blog"
  logo: "/favicon.png"
  description: "Insights, tutorials, and stories from a curious mind."
  ```

  * `title` appears in your browser tab and navigation.
  * `logo` points to an image inside your `/public` directory.
  * `description` is used for SEO and social previews.
  
  ## üì∞ Blog Page Configuration
  
  Customize the header on your `/blog` page.

  ```ts
  blogPageTitle: "News"
  blogPageDescription: "Welcome to my blog! Here you'll find thoughts, guides, and inspiration on web development, design, and more."
  blogPageIcon: BookOpen
  ```

  * Choose a `Lucide` icon or bring your own.
  * This defines how your blog looks to new visitors.

  ## üîç SEO Settings

  These values help search engines and social media platforms understand and preview your site.

  ```ts
  seo: {
    defaultTitle: "My Awesome Blog - Insights and Tutorials",
    defaultDescription: "A personal blog sharing insights, tutorials, and stories about technology, development, and creativity.",
    keywords: ["blog", "technology", "development", "tutorials", "insights", "web development"],
    author: "Your Name",
    language: "en",
    siteUrl: "https://yourdomain.com",
    ogImage: "/og-image.png",
    twitterImage: "/twitter-image.png",
    favicon: "/favicon.png",
  }
  ```

  * These values are injected into your HTML `<head>` automatically.
  * Be sure your images are stored in `/public` and sized correctly for social sharing (e.g., 1200x630px).

  ## üß™ Feature Toggles

  Want to turn off search? Hide reading time? Easy.

  ```ts
  features: {
    enableSearch: true,
    enableTags: true,
    enableRelatedPosts: true,
    enableReadingTime: true,
    enableBackToTop: true,
    enableDarkMode: undefined
  }
  ```

  Set any of these to `false` to disable the feature site-wide.

  ## üé® Display Settings

  Control how much metadata shows on each post preview.

  ```ts
  display: {
    showFeaturedPosts: true,
    showPostDates: true,
    showPostAuthors: true,
    showPostTags: true,
    showPostExcerpts: true,
  }
  ```

  * Turn off tags or author names if you prefer a cleaner UI.
  * `showFeaturedPosts` enables a special featured posts section on your homepage.

  ## üåê Social Media Links

  Your blog can link directly to your profiles:

  ```ts
  social: {
    twitter: "https://twitter.com/yourusername",
    github: "https://github.com/stefangotikj/tinynews-blog",
    linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername",
    youtube: "https://youtube.com/@yourchannel",
    instagram: "https://instagram.com/yourusername",
    facebook: "https://facebook.com/yourpage",
  }
  ```

  Remove or comment out platforms you don't use. These links appear in your footer and author cards.

  ## ü¶∂ Footer Settings

  Personalize the bottom of your site.

  ```ts
  footer: {
    showSocialLinks: true,
    copyrightText: "¬© 2024 My Awesome Blog. All rights reserved.",
  }
  ```

  Keep it minimal, or make it your brand statement.

  ## üí° Pro Tip

  Since `site-config.ts` is just a TypeScript file, you can compute values dynamically or import constants from other files. Want to centralize SEO keywords or add multi-language support? Totally possible.

  ## üöÄ Final Words

  Tinynews was designed with configurability in mind ‚Äî no clunky CMS, no hidden settings. Your blog is just code and content, side-by-side.

  So go ahead, tweak, theme, rebrand ‚Äî and share your voice with the world.

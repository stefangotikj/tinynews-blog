  # Welcome to Tinynews ðŸ“°

  We're thrilled to have you here!

  **Tinynews** is a minimal blogging system built for developers and creators who prefer writing in Markdown and keeping full control over their content. Whether you're starting a personal blog, documenting a project, or sharing tutorials â€” Tinynews has you covered.

  ## Why We Built Tinynews

  In a world full of bloated CMSs and platform lock-in, we wanted to build something different:
  
  - **Zero dependencies** â€” no database, no backend, no fuss.
  - **Markdown-first** â€” content is easy to write, version, and maintain.
  - **Static by default** â€” everything compiles into a blazing-fast site.
  - **Editable by you** â€” powered by YAML frontmatter, Markdown content, and Git.

  You write posts like this one in a single `.yaml` file â€” no plugins, no proprietary editor.

  ## Who Is It For?

  Tinynews is made for:
  
  - Indie hackers and startup teams looking for a quick blog setup
  - Developers who want full control without spinning up a CMS
  - Anyone who values **portability**, **simplicity**, and **open-source ethos**

  ## What's Next?

  To get started:
  
  1. Fork the Tinynews repo or clone your own
  2. Navigate to `src/blog-posts/`
  3. Add your first `.yaml` post
  4. Deploy via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

  We're just getting started, and we hope Tinynews helps you tell your story â€” your way.

  Stay tuned for more updates!

  â€” **The Tinynews Team**

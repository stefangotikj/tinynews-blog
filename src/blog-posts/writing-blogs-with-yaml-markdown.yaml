  # Writing Blog Posts with YAML and Markdown

  Creating blog posts with our headless CMS is simple - just create a YAML file in your `src/blog-posts` folder and write your content in Markdown. Here's everything you need to know.

  ## 📁 Basic File Structure

  Each blog post is a single `.yaml` file with this structure:

  ```yaml
  id: my-first-post
  slug: my-first-post
  title: My First Blog Post
  excerpt: A short description of what this post is about
  author: Your Name
  date: 2024-07-30
  tags:
    - blogging
    - tutorial
  readTime: 3 min
  content: |
    # Your Markdown content goes here
    
    Write your blog post using **Markdown** formatting!
  ```

  ## ✏️ Essential Markdown for Blogging

  ### Headers
  ```markdown
  # Main Title (H1)
  ## Section Header (H2)  
  ### Subsection (H3)
  ```

  ### Text Formatting
  ```markdown
  **Bold text** for emphasis
  *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
  `inline code` for technical terms
  ```

  ### Links and Images
  ```markdown
  [Link text](https://example.com)
  ![Image description](image.jpg)
  ```

  ### Lists
  ```markdown
  - Simple bullet point
  - Another point
  - Third point

  1. Numbered list
  2. Second item
  3. Third item
  ```

  ### Code Blocks
  ```markdown
  ```javascript
  function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }
  ```
  ```

  ### Quotes
  ```markdown
  > This is a blockquote
  > Perfect for highlighting important points
  ```

  ## 🏷️ YAML Front Matter Fields

  ### Required Fields
  - `id`: Unique identifier (no spaces, use dashes)
  - `slug`: URL-friendly version of your title
  - `title`: Your blog post title
  - `content`: Your Markdown content (use `|` for multi-line)

  ### Optional Fields
  - `featured`: Set to `true` to highlight this post
  - `excerpt`: Short description for previews
  - `author`: Who wrote this post
  - `date`: When it was published (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `tags`: List of relevant tags
  - `readTime`: Estimated reading time

  ## 📝 Writing Tips

  ### Keep Your YAML Clean
  ```yaml
  # Good
  title: How to Build a Website
  
  # Avoid special characters without quotes
  title: "How to Build a Website: A Complete Guide!"
  ```

  ### Use the Pipe Symbol for Content
  ```yaml
  content: |
    This preserves line breaks
    and formatting in your
    Markdown content.
  ```

  ### Organize Your Tags
  ```yaml
  tags:
    - tutorial
    - web-development
    - beginner-friendly
  ```

  ## 🎯 Quick Example

  Here's a complete, simple blog post:

  ```yaml
  id: coffee-brewing-guide
  slug: coffee-brewing-guide

    # The Perfect Coffee Brewing Guide

    Making great coffee at home is easier than you think! Here are my top tips.

    ## What You'll Need

    - Good quality coffee beans
    - Clean water
    - Proper brewing equipment
    - A little patience

    ## The Process

    1. **Grind your beans** just before brewing
    2. **Heat water** to 200°F (just off boiling)
    3. **Pour slowly** in circular motions
    4. **Wait patiently** for 4-6 minutes

    > **Pro tip**: The coffee-to-water ratio should be about 1:15

    ## Final Thoughts

    Great coffee is about consistency and quality ingredients. Practice makes perfect!

    Happy brewing! ☕
  ```

  ## ✅ Best Practices

  - Keep filenames simple: `my-post.yaml`
  - Use consistent date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
  - Write clear, descriptive excerpts
  - Tag posts consistently for better organization
  - Preview your Markdown before publishing

  ## 🚀 Ready to Start?

  1. Create a new `.yaml` file in `src/blog-posts/`
  2. Copy the basic structure above
  3. Write your content in Markdown
  4. Save the file
  5. Your post appears automatically!

  That's it! Your headless CMS handles the rest, turning your simple YAML file into a beautiful blog post.

  # How to Create a New Blog Post in Tinynews

  Creating a new post in Tinynews is as easy as adding a YAML file to the `src/blog-posts/` directory.

  ## 1. Copy an Existing Post

  Use one of the sample files (like `getting-started-tinynews.yaml`) as a template.

  ## 2. Fill in the Fields

  - `id`: A unique identifier (e.g., `my-first-post`)
  - `slug`: The URL path (e.g., `my-first-post`)
  - `title`: Your post’s title
  - `excerpt`: A short summary
  - `author`: Your name
  - `date`: Today’s date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `tags`: A list of relevant tags
  - `readTime`: Estimated reading time (e.g., `4 min`)
  - `content`: Your post, written in Markdown

  ## 3. Write Your Content

  Use Markdown for formatting. You can add headings, lists, images, and code blocks.

  ## 4. Save and Commit

  Save your file, commit it to git, and your post will appear on your blog!

  ```yaml
  id: my-first-post

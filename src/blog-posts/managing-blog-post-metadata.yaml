  # Managing Blog Post Metadata in Tinynews

  Every Tinynews post starts with a YAML frontmatter block. This metadata controls how your post appears and is organized.

  ## Example Frontmatter

  ```yaml
  id: my-post
  slug: my-post
  featured: true
  title: My Post Title
  excerpt: A short summary of my post.
  author: Your Name
  date: 2024-07-16
  tags:
    - tutorial
    - example
  readTime: 4 min
  ```

  ## Field Explanations

  - `id`: Unique identifier for the post (no spaces)
  - `slug`: URL path for the post
  - `featured`: Show this post as featured (true/false)
  - `title`: The postâ€™s title
  - `excerpt`: Short summary for previews
  - `author`: Who wrote the post
  - `date`: Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD)
  - `tags`: List of topics for filtering/search

  ## Tips

  - Use clear, descriptive titles and excerpts.
